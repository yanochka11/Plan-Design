OUTPUT:
To create a meeting hall layout with the specified furniture items, I need to first determine the appropriate size for each piece within the 9.0m by 8.2m room. Each furniture item should be placed strategically, considering both the room dimensions and the need for a balanced layout. 

I will start by assigning names to each furniture item as per the given schema. Next, I'll calculate reasonable size values for each furniture, ensuring they fit within the room while adding some visual interest without causing overlaps. For example, placing a table somewhere not too close to other elements, and arranging beds and wardroves spaced out to allow natural movement inside the hall. 

Once the size parameters are defined, I will compute the positions using average relative spacing to maintain a harmonious look. After positioning, I'll ensure that all items are within the room's boundaries. Finally, I'll write the JSON structure to represent these items, assigning calculated sizes while maintaining realistic positioning both for visual interest and practical layout.

OUTPUT:
To create the meeting hall layout, I'll start by considering each furniture item placed strategically within the 9.0m x 8.2m dimensions, avoiding overlaps while keeping a minimal gap of 0.4m around each piece. I'll place each item in different corners initially and then adjust their placements to fit without exceeding the room size. After positioning, I'll ensure each furniture item has a realistic size using the given length and width values, placing them within the center while maintaining a natural spacing effect. This arrangement will balance the placement within the room while adhering to design principles.
