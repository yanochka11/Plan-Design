OUTPUT:
Alright, so the user is asking for a detailed office layout design using specific furniture. They want exactly five common items in a 6.7m by 8.1m room. First, I need to calculate the sizes of each furniture item to ensure they fit without overlapping. I'll start by listing the furniture options like a sofa, desk, bookshelve, chair, and wardrobe. Then, I'll determine their realistic proportions within the room dimensions. For example, after assessing potential sizes based on the room's area, I'll assign appropriate 'length' and 'width' to each. I'll also choose their ideal placement using coordinates, ensuring they don't interfere with each other by maintaining the required minimal gap. Finally, I'll validate the layout to make sure it fits within the room and provides a functional design. This approach will result in a well-organized and realistic office layout.

OUTPUT:
Alright, so I need to design an office layout with five common furniture items. The office has specific dimensions, 6.7 meters by 8.1 meters. I need to ensure that each item is placed correctly without overlapping. I'll start by jotting down the furniture I might need—a desk, maybe a chair, a wall lamp, a wardrobe, and a bookshelve. I should make sure each has the right size and realign them strategically within the room. Let me lay them out one by one, calculating their sizes and places them in a way that makes sense room-wise. I'll give each item a brief note on why I placed it there to align with visual appeal without perfecting each detail. Finally, I'll structure the JSON with each object representing a furniture item, detailing their name, size, and positioning coordinates.
