OUTPUT:
Alright, let's tackle this layout challenge. The user wants a living room with exactly five common furniture items. I need to think about realistic sizes and positions that fit within 5.2m by 6.6m. Starting with the bed, it's the most obvious choice. Then, a sofa comes next. Tables are common, so that's a good option. WOODWAPPLIERS are popular in interiors, so they're next. Finally, a wardrobe makes sense to fill the remaining space. I'll ensure each object has a minimal gap, avoid overlaps, and keep the center coordinates for positioning aligned. This layout should meet the user's requirements effectively.

OUTPUT:
Alright, so the user wants me to create a layout for a Living Room with 5 unique furniture items. They specified exact dimensions of 5.2m by 6.6m, so I need to make sure everything fits without overlapping and leaves a minimal gap. I also need to choose common furniture items only. I'll start by listing out the furniture items available: bed, sofa, table, wardrobe, and chair.

For the bed since it's usually larger, I'll calculate the dimensions based on average sizes, I think 1.8m by 0.9m should be enough space. Next, the sofa should accommodate a standard size, maybe around 1.. So a 0.8m by .4m will fit without too much space. The table needs to be accessible, so about .6m x .6m fit here. W wardrobe makes sense to fit with 1.2m by .8m,it’ll have most of the storage,no overlaps,but lets do something easy fit.

Now,I need to figure positioning inside the room.Think about center placement,it depends on room size,but since room is a LShape with center coordinates(approx 2.6,3.3).Since layout may be centered,but rooms are often unregulated ,so have think minimal distance.

I need to make realistic sizes for each item.No small items,but ensure space makes sense.Alignment must avoid overlaps,but need good reasoning.Alternatives but only choose 5,so think to make unique dimensions,but it may difficult.But room needs 5 objects layout layout OK.

Need to design all elements into layout OK now with all rules laid out. Must arrange size in room and calculate gaps minimal. Think in steps,but start properly to prevent mistakes。

I think best done step by step。
