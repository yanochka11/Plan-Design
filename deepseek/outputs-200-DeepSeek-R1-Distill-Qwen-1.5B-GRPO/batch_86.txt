OUTPUT:
Additionally, here are the furniture items available for inclusion in the Living Room layout:

1. **Bed**: Meets the overall room dimensions.
2. **Sofa**: Spacious in the design.
3. **Table**: A practical addition in the central area.
4. **Chairs**: A comfortable addition with appropriate sized arms.
5. **Bookshelf**: A stylish addition adding some visual flair.

Now, let me suggest the final layout with furniture items within the required dimensions:

OUTPUT:
2D Interior Design Assistant...

I will create a layout for a Living Room consisting of 5 unique furniture items within the specified dimensions of 9.1 meters by 9.8 meters. To achieve this, I will calculate the appropriate sizes for each furniture item while ensuring minimal overlap based on the user's instructions.

First, I will choose common furniture items such as a Bed, Table, Bedside Table, Sofa, and wardrobe. The Bed will occupy a central position, with the Bedside Table shifted slightly to one side. The Bedding will be placed on top of the Bed. The sofa will be positioned in the opposite corner, and a larger wardrobe will be placed near the opposite side, creating a balanced and realistic layout.

I will calculate the sizes of each furniture item based on standard dimensions suitable for a room of size 9.1 x 9.8 meters, ensuring they fit within the given space without overlapping each other unnecessarily. For each furniture item, I will determine the appropriate size that maintains the layout within the constraints while creating a cohesive and functional design.

Finally, I will position each furniture item within the coordinate system centered at the center of the Living Room, calculating the 'x' and 'y' coordinates to determine each furniture item's placement within the 9.1 x 9.8 meter dimensions.
