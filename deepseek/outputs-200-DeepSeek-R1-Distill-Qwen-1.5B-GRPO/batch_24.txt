OUTPUT:
Alright, so I'm trying to design a bedroom layout for a 2D interior design project. The room is 7.1 meters in length and 6.6 meters in width. I need to fit exactly 5 unique, common furniture items. I should think about where each piece makes the most sense. 

First, I remember the common furniture items: bed, chair, wardrobe, bookshelf, and maybe a desk or desk drawer. But wait, the user said not to include window, wall, door, etc. So I'll stick with bed, chairs, wardrobe, and some bookshelves. Hmm, no, I need exactly 5.

Okay, maybe a bed for the main area, a nightstand for the lower left, a wardrobe in the lower right, a bookshelf for the adjacent wall, and a desk or chair for the center. That's 5 items. But let me think about the positioning.

The room is 7.1m by 6.6m. To center the furniture, I need to take the dimensions of each piece into account. Maybe the bed is 1.5m by 0.5m. That would place it in the center at (3.55, 3.3). Then the nightstand could be 0.8m by 0.5m in the lower left, at (0.1, 0. ). The wardrobe could be 0.5m by 1.2m, maybe at (3.15, 5. ), which is near the lower right. The bookshelf might be 1.2m by 0.6m, placed on top of the nightstand, around (0.1, 7. ), but 7. cannot be more than 6.6, so maybe at (0.1, 5. ). Lastly, the desk or chair could be 0.8m by 0.5m at the center of the room, at (3.55, 3.3 ). Wait, no, the desk is supposed to be in the center, so maybe I can adjust.

Wait, let me adjust the positions. The nightstand at (0.1, 0.), wardrobe at (3.15, 5. ), bookshelf at (0.1, 5. ), desk at (3.55, 3.3 ), and bed at (3.55, 3.3 ). Hmm, maybe that's overlapping.

Alternatively, place bed at center, nightstand in lower left, desk in center, wardrobe in lower right, bookshelf on the wall next to desk. That way, each piece is unique and not overlapping. Let me try:

Bed center: 3.55, 3.3.

Nightstand at (0.1, -0.1) but adjusted to fit, so 0.1, 0.0.

Desk at (3.55, 3.3 - 0.2), but desk is better at center. Maybe 3.55, 2.8.

 Wardrobe at (3.55, 5.0) - but it needs to be in the lower right, maybe 3.55, 5.0.

Bookshelf at 3.55, 6.1, but it's on the wall, maybe.

So the final positions would be:

1. Bed: {name: 'bed', size: {length: 1.5, width: 0.5}, position: {x: 3.55, y: 3.3}}

2. Nightstand: {name: 'nightstand', size: {length: 0.8, width: 0.5}, position: {x: 0.1, y: 0.0}}

3. Wardrobe: {name: 'wardrobe', size: {length: 0.5, width: 1.2}, position: {x: 3.55, y: 5.0}}

4. Bookshelf: {name: 'bookshelf', size: {length: 1.2, width: 0.6}, position: {x: 0.1, y: 6.1}}

5. Desk: {name: 'desk', size: {length: 0.8, width: 0.5}, position: {x: 3.55, y: 2.8}}

This layout seems to place each piece in unique areas without overlapping. The bed is central, nightstand in the lower left, desk also near the center but lower, wardrobe in the lower right, and bookshelf on the wall. Each has unique sizes and positions, fitting within the room dimensions and avoiding overlaps.

OUTPUT:
Okay, so I need to create a JSON layout for a bedroom with exactly five unique furniture items. Each item should be within the room dimensions of 7.1m by 6.6m, arranged in a realistic way within these limits.

First, I'll start by identifying common furniture that fits well into a bedroom. The most common ones would include a bed, maybe a dresser or nightstand, a wardrobe, a chair, and perhaps a bookshelf.

I need to make sure each piece has realistic dimensions. For the bed, a standard size is around 2m by 1.5m. That leaves some space, so a wardrobe next to it would be helpful. Depending on how big the bedroom is, I could have a wardrobe that's 2.3m by 0.8m, which would leave some empty space.

Next, a chair looks like a good fit. Placing it next to the bed and wardrobe, I can have it 1.3m by 0.6m. That leaves some area, so the bookshelf should be in that remaining space. I'll go for a 1.2m by 0.4m bookshelf, which is not too big but provides a dedicated place for reading.

For the dresser, a size of 1.5m by 0.8m should work. Placing it above the bed or wardrobe seems reasonable. The nightstand could take up a 1.1m by 0.4m space, giving it a decent amount of room. On top of the nightstand, maybe add an end table that's 0.4m by 1.5m to create a nice area for reading or relaxing.

Considering the overall layout, the bed should be placed in the center. The wardrobe and bookshelf should be on one side, while the dressing, nightstand, and end table go on the opposite side. This creates a balanced and functional bedroom layout.

I need to make sure each piece doesn't overlap and stays within the room dimensions. The positions (x, y) should be calculated so that each furniture item has the correct size, avoiding collisions.

Finally, I'll format everything as valid JSON within the provided structure, ensuring that all required properties are included and properly formatted. I'll check that each object in the array has "name," "size," and "position" with consistent numerical values, making sure there are no missing or extra property types.
