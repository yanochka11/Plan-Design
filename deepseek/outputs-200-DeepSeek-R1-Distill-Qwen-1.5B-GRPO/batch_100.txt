OUTPUT:
Alright, let's tackle this desk layout with the furniture provided. I need to make sure everything fits within the 5.8m x 8.0m room without overlapping. 

First, for the bed, since it's a common piece, I'll go with a standard size. Maybe 0.8m by 0.6m to make it slightly wider and have some space around it.

Next, the desk should have a nice touch without overshadowing the bed. A slight edge might be good, so around 0.6m by 0.4m will keep it flanked by the bed nicely.

Then, the wardrobe needs some personality. A slightly more sizable fit could be 0.8m by 0.2m to give it a bit of a pop without being too bulky.

Looking for a chair that complements the desk and bed, a bit more open would be better. It's important to place it slightly taller so it adds another dimension to the desk.

Lastly, the sideboard should have enough room to expand into if needed. Maybe a 0.4m by 0.4m piece to make it look balanced in the center.

I need to calculate the positioning to ensure each item is within the room and doesn't overlap. Maybe starting around the lower left for the bed, then adjusting each following furniture item accordingly.

OUTPUT:
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user wants to design an office layout using exactly 5 unique furniture items. The office dimensions are 5.8 meters by 8.0 meters. I need to figure out the best way to fit furniture with minimal overlap, ensuring that each item has a realistic size.

First, I'll consider the furniture items available: bed, sofa, table, wardrobe, and chair. Since the user didn't specify particular styles, I'll choose common options that look professional.

Next, I'll start by positioning the bed towards one of the longer sides, say the right side, giving it more room towards the edges. This way, I can fit other furniture there. After placing the bed, I'll assign realistic sizes to the remaining items.

Looking at the 5.8m by 8.0m space, 8 meters is the overall width. If I lay out a sofa along the left side, its smaller dimensions should give it enough floor space. I'll balance this with ensuring it doesn't extend too far and allows room for other components.

Adjustments in layout are crucial. Since the initial placement might exceed the space vertically or horizontally, I'll tweak each item's placement to fit snugly without causing overlaps. Perhaps staggering some furniture could offer a better flow.

Finally, after positioning all furniture within the boundaries, I'll check the entire layout to ensure there's no overlap, each item respects the room dimension, and the gaps meet the minimal requirements specified by the user. This configuration should provide a cohesive and functional office setup.
