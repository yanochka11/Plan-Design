OUTPUT:
Okay, so I need to create a layout for a Dining Room with exactly 5 unique, common furniture items. The room dimensions are 9.9 meters in length and 6.0 meters in width, and I need to ensure there's a minimal gap of at least 0.4 meters between each piece of furniture, without any overlaps.

First, I'll start by sketching out where different furniture pieces might go. A classic choice for a dining room is a sofa or chair, so maybe I'll place the sofa near the center. Then, for a modern twist, a table or coffee table would work well. A bookshelves and a wardrobe could add some character and storage space, while a coffee table or small storage box might help organize the space.

Next, I'll assign some realistic dimensions to each furniture piece. For the sofa, an 180 cm by 103 cm size seems reasonable. The coffee table and wardrobe could be 750 mm by 500 mm and 750 mm by 600 mm respectively, considering standard sizes. The bookshelves might be 700 mm by 450 mm and 600 mm by 450 mm to provide vertical space. The wardrobe could be 650 mm by 600 mm, and the coffee table again 750 mm by 500 mm.

After assigning the positions, I'll ensure they're within the room dimensions and spaced out with a minimal gap to prevent overlap. I'll make sure the center coordinates (x, y) are calculated based on the room's dimensions, with 0,0 at the bottom left corner.

Finally, I'll structure this all into a JSON array format, ensuring all objects have the required properties and that the layout is valid.

OUTPUT:
Okay, I need to create a layout for a Dining Room with exactly 5 unique, common furniture items. The room has dimensions of 9.9m (length) x 6.0m (width). I should choose furniture that fits within these dimensions, ensuring there's a minimal gap of around 0.4m between objects and no overlaps.

First, I'll consider the best positions for each piece. Maybe the first chair can be at the center, the second can be on one end, the third in the middle, the fourth on the other end, and the fifth as a wall near the door. This seems balanced and realistic.

Next, I'll assign the furniture items from most common to less common. A simple Chair with classic size would be an easy choice for the first position. Then, a Bed might be a bit more elevated, but it's still a common bed. For the third position, maybe a Table with a simple style since it's versatile. The fourth can be another chair, perhaps a bit more compact, and the fifth as a Wall with a simple door style.

I'll ensure each item has a standard size, like 0.2m x 0.2m for the chair and bed, and 0.3m x 0.3m for the table. I'll position the fifth item near the door with a small gap. 

I need to make sure the layout doesn't exceed the room dimensions and maintains a natural look without being too cramped or too spread out. This approach should provide a good balance between comfort and functionality in the Dining Room.
