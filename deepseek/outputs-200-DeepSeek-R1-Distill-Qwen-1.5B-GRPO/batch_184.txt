OUTPUT:
Alright, so the user is asking for a layout for their living room, expecting exactly five unique furniture items. I need to focus on realistic sizes, ensuring they add up within the 6.7m x 7.8m space without overlaps, sticking to common items.

First, I'll consider the size of each piece relative to the room. For a bed, I'll calculate based on room dimensions. Then, each subsequent item will be selected next size up. I'll double-check the proportions to make sure they fit and calculate if necessary.

After laying out, I think about positioning each piece as best fit, maintaining minimal gaps but preventing overlaps. I'll note the realistic placement coordinates, avoiding fractions. Finally, organizing everything into an array within specified JSON format.

OUTPUT:
Alright, the user is asking for a layout of five distinct furniture items in a living room that perfectly fits within a 6.7m by 7.8m space without any overlaps. I need to choose common furniture and calculate realistic dimensions to ensure everything fits. I'll start by listing possible items: a nightstand, coffee table, side chair, wardrobe, and bookshelve. Next, I'll determine the sizes for each, making sure they're realistic and allow for natural spacing. I'll calculate the required lengths and widths, then decide the positioning in the room's center. Finally, I'll structure the JSON layout with each room location properly assigned to avoid overlaps, ensuring it's both functional and visually appealing. I'll confirm each dimension is practical and allows natural movement without clutter.
