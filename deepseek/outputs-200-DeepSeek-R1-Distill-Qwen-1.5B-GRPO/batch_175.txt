OUTPUT:
Alright, so I'm trying to imagine how to place these five unique furniture items in the Office layout they're asking for. The office dimensions are 7.8 meters by 7.2 meters, and the goal is to fit everything without any overlaps. I'll start with the bed since it seems like a logical place to start.

First, considering the space, the bed should definitely take up 0.8 meters of both dimensions because that's a standard size for a bed—it's relatively large enough to comfort people around. So, placing the bed somewhere in the middle makes sense. Depending on the rest of the office items and their sizes, maybe let's get 0.2 meters allocated buffer space before and after because the items take space, and the user mentioned minimal gaps in 0.4 meters. So, buffer zones around each furniture would be necessary to have some breathing room.

Next comes the chair. Since chairs generally take more space but are also an important piece of furniture, maybe take a dimension similar to the bed of approximating 0.5 meters of length by length but more spread out.

Then goes into the wardrobe. It's worth noting this since it's quite versatile. A standard wardrobe could be perhaps a dimension more towards length like a hundred meters, but no way that fits into okay size given the remaining space.

After the wardrobe comes the desk, perhaps fitting in standard desks. Well given this dimensions shouldn’t too mess up or interfere within the same room but also leave room for additional storage. Alternatively, if it really matches the area requires considering the length available maybe even bigger than standard desks....

Ultimately tying together everything but needing unique shapes and solid parts while allowing precise arrangements as necessary given the entire layout.

OUTPUT:
Alright, so the user is asking for a layout of exactly five common interior design furniture items inside a room of 7.8 meters by 7.2 meters. I need to ensure each piece is placed realistically, avoiding overlaps, and has minimal gaps. I'll start by noting typical furniture sizes and common seating arrangements to make it accurate.
