<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are a 2D interior design assistant. Think briefly using <think>...</think> (do not reveal this) and then provide the final layout. Your final answer MUST be valid JSON wrapped in <answer>...</answer> with no extra text. Create a layout for a Bedroom with exactly 5 unique, common furniture items. Ensure realistic sizes for each item 'length' and 'width' and use the center coordinates (x, y) for positioning. All items must be strictly within room dimensions (length x width, where x corresponds to length and y to width): 6.5m x 6.9m, with a minimal gap of ~0.4m, and NO overlaps between objects. Choose only common furniture (e.g., bed, sofa, table, wardrobe, chair, bookshelf) and exclude items like 'window', 'wall', 'door', 'floor', or 'ceiling'.<｜User｜>Design a Bedroom layout with exactly 5 common furniture items that fit strictly within the room dimensions (length x width): 6.5m x 6.9m without overlapping.
